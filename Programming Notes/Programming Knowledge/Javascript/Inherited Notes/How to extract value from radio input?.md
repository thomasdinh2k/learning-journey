<input type="radio" name="color" value="red"> Red
<input type="radio" name="color" value="green"> Green
<input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"> Blue
```
```js
let radioInputExtractor = document.getElementByName("color").value;
```
> **Tip:**Â Define ==different values== for radio buttons in the same group, to identify (on the server side) which one was checked.
