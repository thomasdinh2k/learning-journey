This code appears to be a React application that displays a large image and a set of small thumbnail images. Users can click on the small thumbnail images to change the large image being displayed. Here is a summary of the code and its functionality:

1. **App Component (App.js)**:
    
    - Imports React and two custom components, `Large` and `Small`.
    - Initializes a state variable `imageUrl` using the `useState` hook with an initial value of "images/img-1.jpg."
    - Defines a function `setStateImageUrl` that can be used to update the `imageUrl` state.
    - Renders a `div` with the ID "products" containing an `h1` element with the text "Hello World," a `Large` component with the `imageUrl` prop, and a `Small` component with both `imageUrl` and `setStateImageUrl` props.
2. **Small Component (Small.js)**:
    
    - Accepts two props: `updateImgUrl` and `imageUrl`.
    - Defines an array `imageUrlList` containing paths to three thumbnail images.
    - Implements an `imgThumbHandler` function that updates the large image URL when a thumbnail image is clicked.
    - Maps through `imageUrlList` and renders each thumbnail image. The "active" class is applied to the currently selected thumbnail based on a comparison with the `imageUrl` prop.
    - The selected thumbnail's `imgThumbHandler` function is called when a thumbnail is clicked to update the large image.
3. **Large Component (Large.js)**:
    
    - Accepts a single prop, `props`, which contains an `imageURL` prop.
    - Renders a `div` with the ID "large" and an `img` element with its `src` attribute set to the `imageURL` prop. This displays the large image.

In summary, this code creates a React application with an `App` component that manages the state of the large image URL and passes this state down to the `Large` and `Small` components. The `Small` component displays a set of thumbnail images, and when a thumbnail is clicked, it updates the large image displayed by calling a function provided by the `App` component. The `Large` component displays the selected large image.

## Step by Step solving
1. Import necessary libraries and components: The code imports React and custom components, `Large` and `Small`.
    
2. Initialize state in the App component: The App component sets up a state variable `imageUrl` to manage the URL of the large image.
    
3. Define a function to update the image URL: The App component defines a function `setStateImageUrl` that allows updating the `imageUrl` state.
    
4. Render the App component: The App component renders a div with the ID "products," an h1 element with the text "Hello World," and two child components: `Large` and `Small`. It passes the `imageUrl` and `setStateImageUrl` props to the `Small` component.
    
5. Create the Small component: The Small component accepts props for updating the image URL and the current image URL. It displays a set of thumbnail images and applies the "active" class to the selected thumbnail.
    
6. Handle thumbnail clicks: When a user clicks a thumbnail in the Small component, it triggers an event to update the large image URL using the function provided in the App component.
    
7. Create the Large component: The Large component accepts a single prop, `imageURL`, and displays the large image based on the provided URL.
