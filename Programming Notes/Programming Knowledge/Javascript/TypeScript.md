# TypeScript
>> Technically, JavaScript has got types - but since JavaScript is ==dynamically typed==, we just don't know what type of value a variable contains until runtime. TypeScript is marvelous since it adds these annotations as developer tooling with no added runtime overhead. And you get a transpiler for future features too.
