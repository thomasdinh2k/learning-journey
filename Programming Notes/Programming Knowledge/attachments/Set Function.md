> A "set function" is a function you create in a component to change or update component's data

Let's break it down with a simpler example:

Imagine you're building a simple counter app in React. You want to display a number on the screen, and when you click a button, you want that number to increase by 1.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Use the useState hook to create a "state variable" called "count"
  // and a "set function" called "setCount" to change its value.
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Create a function to increase the count when the button is clicked
  function incrementCount() {
    // Use the "setCount" function to update the "count" variable
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;

```
* `useState(0)` sets up a piece of data called *count* with *initial value = 0*
* `setCount` is the **set function** that you use to change the value of *count*
* `function incrementCount()` allow you to `SetCount` to increase the `count` by 1
