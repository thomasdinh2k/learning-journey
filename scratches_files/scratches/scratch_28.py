# This code reads in an image file and resizes it to several different sizes using the `resize_image` function. The function takes two arguments: the path to the image file and a tuple containing the desired size of the resized image. The function then returns the resized image.
#
# The main part of the code prompts the user for the path to an image file and then loops through each size in `sizes`, resizes the image, and saves it to a new file with a modified filename. The code also creates a new folder called "CuppyEmotes_Exported" in the same directory as the original image file if it doesn't already exist.
# Let me know if you have any other questions!
